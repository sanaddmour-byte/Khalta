# Progress log

## 2026-10-01 — M0.1 Repo and tooling

**Changed**

- pnpm workspace + Turborepo (`apps/api`, `apps/web`, `packages/{engine,validator,rules,db,ui}`, `tools/*`); exact versions pinned via a pnpm catalog (TypeScript 6.0.3, because typescript-eslint 8.71 supports `<6.1`).
- Strict TS base config, ESLint 10 flat config, Prettier (spec docs and `CLAUDE.md` are excluded so they stay verbatim).
- Local ESLint plugin `@khalta/eslint-plugin` with `no-hardcoded-ui-strings`, `no-physical-css`, `validator-isolation`, each with RuleTester tests including bypass attempts.
- `tools/boundaries`: dependency-cruiser rule forbidding any path from `packages/validator` to `packages/engine/src/optimizer` (catches barrel re-exports), tested on good/bad fixtures. Part of `pnpm lint`.
- Minimal API (`GET /health`, pino) and web placeholder; Vitest everywhere (engine/validator coverage thresholds 90%); Playwright + axe smoke; `pnpm screens` captures the placeholder AR/EN × 1440/1024/390 (identical until the language toggle exists in M0.3).
- CI workflow, `docker-compose.yml` (Postgres 17), `.env.example`, stubs for `db:migrate`, `db:seed:demo`, `fixtures:export`.

**Commands run (all exit 0):** `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:rules`, `pnpm e2e` (1 test, 0 serious axe violations), `pnpm screens` (6 screenshots in `docs/screens/M0.1/`).
Also verified by temporarily adding violating files: lint reported all three custom rules, and depcruise reported the validator→optimizer path; the files were removed.

**Verification note:** tests prove the tooling enforces the three policies and the command contract runs. They say nothing about concrete engineering. Coverage thresholds are trivially met by placeholder code.

**Notes / open items**

- Context7 MCP not available in this session; versions were taken from the npm registry. Library docs should be read before each library's first real use.
- `esbuild` build script is not approved in pnpm (tsx works without it so far); revisit if `pnpm dev` for the API misbehaves.
- Docs formatting: markdown under `docs/plans` is Prettier-formatted.

**Next:** M0.2 (database, auth, RBAC, audit) — write `docs/plans/M0.2.md` and list questions.
